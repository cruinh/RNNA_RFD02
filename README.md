This is a simple mobile app listing all pokemon reported by `pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon`.  It was generated via `@react-native-community/cli init` and customized by hand.

The point of this project is to be used as a development target for speedrunning the initial creation of a fresh react native app, both for practice and for exploring basic differences between new major versions of react native.
